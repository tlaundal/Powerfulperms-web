# Powerfulperms-web
`[WIP]` A web UI for [powerfulperms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/powerfulperms.8143/), designed for effective permission management.

## Components
Powerfulperms-web consists of two components:

 - **The frontend**, which is a self-contained html/css/javascript web-app that can be served form any static host
 - **The backend**, which connects to redis and mysql to communicate with Powerfulperms

These components can be found in the two subdirectories `frontend` and `backend` in this repo.


*This project is in no way affiliated with the development of the Powerfulperms plugin.*
