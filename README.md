# Powerfulperms-web
[WIP] A web UI for powerfulperms, designed for effective permission management.

## Components
Powerfulperms-web consists of two components:

 - The frontend, which is a self-contained html/css/javascript web-app that can be served form any static host
 - The backend, which connects to redis and mysql to communicate with Powerfulperms

These components can be found in the two subdirectories `frontend` and `backend` in this repo.
